The management of the Group assesses all material claims in the nature of demands against the Group and based on legal advice in certain cases evaluates whether it is probable, possible or remote (PPR).

Further, the management of the Group makes an assessment for uncertain tax positions for direct tax matters and records a provision if it is probable and disclose it as part of contingent liabilities when it is assessed as possible in nature.

The show cause notices (SCN) including intimation prior to SCN relating to direct and indirect taxes have neither been acknowledged as claims nor considered as contingent liability and hence, not disclosed. However, the Group has considered SCNs received on a matter where demand has already been confirmed under contingent liability.

Contingent liability amount disclosed above includes interest and penalty only to the extent such amounts are demanded by various tax authorities through demand order.

The Group discloses voluntarily for the material cases (for which demands have been received) that are assessed as remote as part of PPR analysis and are included in the above amount.

## i) Stamp duty

The Group had received demand in certain states for stamp duty on execution of Leave and Licence Agreement of Cell Sites.

## ii) Entry tax

The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in November 2016, with the nine-member bench, upheld the constitutional validity i.e. the states are empowered to design the legislation w.r.t. levy of Entry Tax.

However, the Court directed the matter to respective High Courts on the issue whether or not the respective State Entry tax Acts are discriminatory in nature.

Basis directions from Supreme Court, fresh writ petitions were filed before High Courts of several States on the ground of discrimination. The Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad in the case of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., upheld the constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Entry Tax Act followed by Hon'ble High Court of Bombay in the case of Hindustan National Glass &amp; Industries Ltd. Recently, the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay (Goa Bench) in the case of the Company followed the judgment of High Court Allahabad &amp; Bombay and upheld the constitutional validity of Goa Entry Tax Act.

The Group has accordingly reassessed the merits of the ongoing matters and created a provision of C 1,379 Mn for entry tax liability and capitalised the same in the property, plant and equipment. Corresponding impact of depreciation amounting to C 1,270 Mn has been charged in the statement of profit and loss. Further, the Group has also taken an interest provision of C 499 Mn due to short payment made under protest. The Group will continue to pursue legal action in all these states.

The Group has opted for Amnesty schemes in certain states for settlement of outstanding demand.

## iii)  Sales tax/ VAT/ GST

The claims for Sales tax/VAT comprise mainly of the case relating to levy of VAT on right to use in goods &amp; nonsubmission of concessional forms. The demand for GST mainly pertains to disallowance of Input tax credit availed by the Group on passive infrastructure assets other than towers.

## iv)  Municipal taxes

The Group based on its assessment of the applicability and tenability of certain municipal levies, which is an industry wide phenomenon, does not consider the impact of such levies to be material. Further, in the event these

The management of the Company assesses all material claims in the nature of demands against the Company and based on legal advice in certain cases evaluates whether it is probable, possible or remote (PPR).

Further, the management of the Company makes an assessment for uncertain tax positions for direct tax matters and records a provision if it is probable and disclose it as part of contingent liabilities when it is assessed as possible in nature.

The  show  cause  notices  (SCN)  including  intimation  prior  to  SCN  relating  to  direct  and  indirect  taxes  have neither been acknowledged as claims nor considered as contingent liability and hence, not disclosed. However, the  Company has considered SCNs received on a matter where demand has already been confirmed under contingent liability.

Contingent liability amount disclosed above includes interest and penalty only to the extent such amounts are demanded by various tax authorities through demand order.

The  Company  discloses  voluntarily  for  the  material  cases  (for  which  demands  have  been  received)  that  are assessed as remote as part of PPR analysis and are included in the above amount.

LLM Analysis Result:
TITLE: The amount of interest paid by the buyer in terms of Section 16 of the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006, along with the amounts of the payment made to the supplier beyond the appointed day during each accounting year
TYPE: Financial data related to interest payments and accruals
CONTENT: The table contains information about the amount of interest paid, accrued, and remaining unpaid by the buyer to the supplier under the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006, for delayed payments.
IS_CONTINGENT_LIABILITY: False
REASON: This table does not relate to contingent liabilities, which are uncertain future obligations like legal cases or tax disputes. Instead, it provides specific details about interest payments and accruals related to delayed payments to suppliers, which is a known and quantifiable obligation. The table appears to be related to guarantees/commitments, specifically the commitment to pay interest on delayed payments to suppliers as per the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Development Act, 2006. However, it is more accurately described as a disclosure of interest payments and accruals rather than a guarantee or commitment in the traditional sense.

CONTENT: This table outlines the future minimum lease income that the company expects to receive, categorized by the timing of receipt: within one year, between one and five years, and beyond five years.
IS_CONTINGENT_LIABILITY: False
REASON: The table does not relate to contingent liabilities, which are uncertain future obligations. Instead, it presents a schedule of expected lease income, which is a form of commitment or contractual agreement, but from the perspective of revenue the company anticipates receiving, not obligations it might have to fulfill. It's about the income side related to leases, not about liabilities or guarantees the company has given.

REASON: I classified it this way because the table specifically mentions "Guarantees issued by banks and financial institutions on behalf of the Group", which indicates that it relates to guarantees or commitments given by the company, rather than contingent liabilities like uncertain future obligations. The table provides a clear and specific type of commitment, which is a guarantee, and does not imply uncertainty or potential future obligations like contingent liabilities would.

CONTENT: The table contains information about contingent liabilities, specifically taxes, duties, and other demands that are under adjudication, appeal, or dispute, including stamp duty, entry tax, sales tax/VAT/GST, and municipal taxes.
IS_CONTINGENT_LIABILITY: True
REASON: I classified it this way because the table explicitly mentions "under adjudication/appeal/dispute", which indicates that these are uncertain future obligations, and the table title is not explicitly provided but the content suggests it is related to contingent liabilities. The presence of terms like "under adjudication", "appeal", and "dispute" further supports this classification, as these are characteristic of contingent liabilities.
